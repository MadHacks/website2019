                        A hackathon is an event where students gather together to work on a software or hardware project. MadHacks Carbon will be a 24 hour hackathon.

                        We encourage students to work with a team of 2 - 4 people but you can work individually as well. If you don't have a team yet, there will be a team formation after the opening ceremony. If you want to find a team before the event, join the #team-formation slack channel.

                        We welcome undergraduate and graduate students of all backgrounds. You donâ€™t need to be a Computer Science or Engineering major to attend. If you don't know how to code, we will have workshops that teach you how to code and mentors that can help you with your project. We will also be providing travel reimbursements for students travling from other schools as well!

We anticipate being able to provide travel reimbursements for students traveling from outside the Madison area. We are working out more logistic details but are currently able to reimburse up to $50 with proof of purchase. Please bring your receipt to the event in order to qualify for reimbursements.
